Abilities
----
Abilities composed out of target(s) and effect(s)
Abilities have a range, area of effect, and/or a number of targets. Abilities can be actively used or passive
    Passive abilities cannot be "used" and cannot use "apply when used" effects

Effects may have: element, magnitude, influence (buff/debuff target), duration, trigger, summon type
    Only damage effects require an element type
    Damage effects may only influence stats (health and energy)
    Buff/Debuff effects may influence stats and attributes
    move influences position
    summon effects must have a summon type, indicating what is summoned


Target                                   Effect
note: increasing expensiveness           note: 1 ability can have more than 1 effect

                                         effects:


Attribute points and Ability points
----
Option 1
-----
Characters are granted X attribute points and Y ability points

- Creating an ability only costs 1 ability point, regardless of what it does
    - More powerful abilities require more energy to use
    - problem: passives would be arbitrarily powerful
- Increasing an attribute costs n attribute points, for n = f(level)

Option 2
----
Characters are granted X attribute points, Y active ability points, Z passive ability point

- Creating an active ability costs 1 ability point, regardless of what it does
    - More powerful abilities require more energy to use
- Creating a passive ability requires N points, determined by how potent the ability is
- Increasing an attribute costs n attribute points, for n = f(level)

Option 3
----
Characters are granted n XP points, which can be spent on attributes and abilities as desired

- Creating an active ability costs x XP points, for some constant x
    - at higher levels characters could acquire large numbers of abilities for negligible XP cost
- Creating a passive ability costs x XP points, determined by potency
- Increasing an attribute costs n XP points, for n = f(level)
- Increasing an affinity costs n XP points, for n = f(level)

Option 4
----
- Creating an active ability costs x XP points, for x = f(total xp)
    - Can limit how many active abilities a character can take
    - balancing xp between abilities and attributes could be difficult

Option 5
----
- Create a new active ability after acquiring enough total XP points, for cost 0 <= x <= y
    - Limits a characters active abilities
    - No difficulty deciding whether or not to take an ability or attributes
    - Can make "perks" that trade XP for more ability slots
- Creating a new passive ability requires `n` XP points, for n = f(ability_potency)
-

Option 6
----
On character creation, grant w attribute points, x affinity points, y ability points
    impose upper limit on ability potency


want:
    - freedom to design and create abilities as desired
    - possibility to upgrade existing abilities, so that abilities taken early on don't become worthless
        - option(s):
            - cost scaled to potency, pay with xp or ability points
            - new ability point(s) after N xp points

don't want:
    - players to simply take every possible kind of ability
        - must place some limit on how many abilities can be taken


Affinities

    + x soak against element_type damage effects
    - y cost when using element_type abilities
