to do:
----
optimize rendering process

make proper file selector with directory viewer


discrete controls/indicator for slider
    - too slow, too many things to draw


set timeout on tip bar text?
implement fade-out and colors in tip bar text?


change Tab_Buttons to be Toggles


re-organize theme profiles in the color editor
    - scrollable tab bar?
    - scrollable pull-out drawer?


re-do menus
    - create character
    - load character
        - select world
        - select place
        - select event
    - options
        - color options
        - exit from the options menu
            - save character when exiting


consider moving aoe to effects rather than abilities

make grid cell text toggle-able

make tab bars scrollable if excess tabs are present


add battles to gui
    - make a grid - done
    - place characters in a given region in the grid - done
    - collect input from players
        - select an ability
            - use the selection from the abilities viewer to select an ability
            - left click on grid to select target(s)
        - click accept button to submit action to queue

    - process
    - display effects in gui
    - outcome

put increment costs on tip bar text for -/+ buttons in attributes/affinities


finish converting autoreferences:
    - do tabs/window
    - do sdl_window

rules editor
move save character from options to character screen



indicate unusable buttons as being unusable (e.g. grey-out)

fade-out effects for hide/show
hide/show buttons
    - mouseover to left/right/top/bottom to see hide/show buttons

change menus to nested/recursive menus where appropriate



change back to grid




add energy source drop-down box for abilities?
remove homing option?
    - defining a fair cost seems difficult
    - completely negates ability to dodge, assuming target is within range
    - no reason not to take it if it's cheap
    - still worth taking if it's expensive?


determine how aoe works
    - aoe=0 means hits only target
    - aoe=1 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=2 hits all entities < 2 squares away

    or
    - aoe=target hits only target
    - aoe=0 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=1 hits all entities <= 1 square away
    - aoe=2 hits all entities <= 2 squares away

implement aoe for passives?
figure out movement effects
implement summon effects


fix format_attributes to display nicely spaced entries

Known Issues
------
Expressions such as 2 ^ (2 ^ 128) in the rules can cause the program to hang

text_background_color causes sdl2.ext.font to hiccup. The following change to sdl2.ext.font "fixes" it (but still doesn't display text background color)

    - had to install not yet accepted patch https://github.com/marcusva/py-sdl2/pull/134



Unrelated
----
write tool that determines if package module name shadows built-in module name


Roadmap
-----

finish implementing effects - done?!
implement levels/xp/level-up costs
guided character creation and how-to write a character sheet
make pre-designed abilities
test/balance default rules + test ai + how to write rules
multiple characters on a team (NvK e.g. monster warrior)
hero/villain status and persuading defeated enemies to join
origin story, quests, equipment
basic graphics (placeholders) and minimum viable product
world maps (graphics)
character customization (graphics)
