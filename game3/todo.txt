finish converting autoreferences:
    - do tabs/window
    - do sdl_window

rules editor
move save character from options to character screen


add tip bar

indicate unusable buttons as being unusable (e.g. grey-out)
fade-out effects for hide/show
hide/show buttons
    - mouseover to left/right/top/bottom to see hide/show buttons

change back to grid

add battles to gui
    - make a grid
    - place characters in a given region in the grid
    - collect input from players
    - process
    - display effects in gui
    - outcome



add energy source drop-down box for abilities?
remove homing option?
    - defining a fair cost seems difficult
    - completely negates ability to dodge, assuming target is within range
    - no reason not to take it if it's cheap
    - still worth taking if it's expensive?


determine how aoe works
    - aoe=0 means hits only target
    - aoe=1 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=2 hits all entities < 2 squares away

    or
    - aoe=target hits only target
    - aoe=0 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=1 hits all entities <= 1 square away
    - aoe=2 hits all entities <= 2 squares away

implement aoe for passives?
figure out movement effects
implement summon effects


fix format_attributes to display nicely spaced entries
