to do:
----

give each window object a texture to cache the result of its drawing

add shooting stars to background
    - make night-from-space background

optimize render
    - batch draw rects of the same color and depth
    - when re-drawing an object, check to see if another object with that size and profile has been drawn
    - don't draw occluded objects
    - if a window object creates a child and that child does not have limited size, then the window object is not visible
        - only if the children are opaque

2d slider pad

create Animations
    - draw each frame and cache it ahead of time
        - must be done after component is organized
    - copy cached frame to screen when rendering



make proper file selector with directory viewer


wire alerts into tip bar text?
set timeout on tip bar text?
implement fade-out and colors in tip bar text?


re-do menus
    - create character
    - load character
        - select world
        - select place
        - select event
    - options
        - color options
        - exit from the options menu
            - save character when exiting


consider moving aoe to effects rather than abilities

make grid cell text toggle-able



add battles to gui
    - make a grid - done
    - place characters in a given region in the grid - done
    - collect input from players
        - select an ability
            - use the selection from the abilities viewer to select an ability
            - left click on grid to select target(s)
        - click accept button to submit action to queue

    - process
    - display effects in gui
    - outcome

put increment costs on tip bar text for -/+ buttons in attributes/affinities


finish converting autoreferences:
    - do tabs/window
    - do sdl_window

rules editor
move save character from options to character screen



indicate unusable buttons as being unusable (e.g. grey-out)

fade-out effects for hide/show
hide/show buttons
    - mouseover to left/right/top/bottom to see hide/show buttons

change menus to nested/recursive menus where appropriate



change back to grid




add energy source drop-down box for abilities?
remove homing option?
    - defining a fair cost seems difficult
    - completely negates ability to dodge, assuming target is within range
    - no reason not to take it if it's cheap
    - still worth taking if it's expensive?


determine how aoe works
    - aoe=0 means hits only target
    - aoe=1 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=2 hits all entities < 2 squares away

    or
    - aoe=target hits only target
    - aoe=0 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=1 hits all entities <= 1 square away
    - aoe=2 hits all entities <= 2 squares away

implement aoe for passives?
figure out movement effects
implement summon effects


fix format_attributes to display nicely spaced entries



theme designer applet


Known Issues
------
Expressions such as 2 ^ (2 ^ 128) in the rules can cause the program to hang

text_background_color causes sdl2.ext.font to hiccup. The following change to sdl2.ext.font "fixes" it (but still doesn't display text background color)

    - had to install not yet accepted patch https://github.com/marcusva/py-sdl2/pull/134

write tool that determines if package module name shadows built-in module name
