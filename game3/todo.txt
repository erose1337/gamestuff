How to encourage a community and creativity
===========================================
- "contribution" points
    - currency acquired from making contributions to the project
    - redeemable for game content
        - content must not provide competitive advantage
        - cosmetics
        - new quests/stories/events/etc
        - pre-designed characters
        - a (paid) copy of the game


Define what menus/content should be available
=============================================
- character viewer
    Each window should have a grid showing the available characters
    Selecting a character should open up a character sheet
    - tab 1: my characters
        - character sheet can be writable
    - tab 2: canonical/default/built-in characters
        - character sheet should be readable only
    - tab 3: public character listing
        - character sheet should be readable only
    - back button: Goes back to top menu
- arcade mode
    Choose n characters for team 1
    Choose n characters for team 2 (or randomly select them)
    Choose an arena
- story mode
    Create new character
    Select a character
- free mode
- options

Mode 1: "Arcade mode"
---------------------
Select a preset character to use against another preset character

- Variation: Select n preset characters to use against k preset characters

This option is short and to the point. It's for people who are most interested in implementing strategy and tactics and actually "playing the game".
Provides opportunity to introduce "canonical" characters.
Characters span a variety of strategies and styles. All characters should have the same amount of total experience points.

Mode 2: "Story mode"
--------------------
Design a new character and start at level 1.

Work through various Events/challenges/etc to gain experience points.

    - see ideas3 for the definition of and examples of Events

This option is for those that like persistence and level ups.


Mode 3: "Free mode"
-------------------
Design/modify characters as desired with no imposed point limits.
Design/play custom Events

This option is for people who just want to have fun. This option should hopefully keep people from feeling the need to cheat in other game modes.


Mode 4: "Characters"
--------------------
View/create/modify/clone characters




enforce ability/effect limits based on current XP in character sheet

- add shooting stars to background
- make night-from-space background

re-do menus
    - create character
    - load character
        - select world
        - select place
        - select event
    - options
        - color options
        - exit from the options menu
            - save character when exiting

consider moving aoe to effects rather than abilities

make grid cell text toggle-able

add battles to gui
    - make a grid - done
    - place characters in a given region in the grid - done
    - collect input from players
        - select an ability
            - use the selection from the abilities viewer to select an ability
            - left click on grid to select target(s)
        - click accept button to submit action to queue

    - process
    - display effects in gui
    - outcome

put increment costs on tip bar text for -/+ buttons in attributes/affinities

rules editor
move save character from options to character screen

change menus to nested/recursive menus where appropriate

change back to grid

add energy source drop-down box for abilities?
remove homing option?
    - defining a fair cost seems difficult
    - completely negates ability to dodge, assuming target is within range
    - no reason not to take it if it's cheap
    - still worth taking if it's expensive?

determine how aoe works
    - aoe=0 means hits only target
    - aoe=1 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=2 hits all entities < 2 squares away

    or
    - aoe=target hits only target
    - aoe=0 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=1 hits all entities <= 1 square away
    - aoe=2 hits all entities <= 2 squares away

implement aoe for passives?
figure out movement effects
implement summon effects

fix format_attributes to display nicely spaced entries

Known Issues
------
Expressions such as 2 ^ (2 ^ 128) in the rules can cause the program to hang

text_background_color causes sdl2.ext.font to hiccup. The following change to sdl2.ext.font "fixes" it (but still doesn't display text background color)

    - had to install not yet accepted patch https://github.com/marcusva/py-sdl2/pull/134

write tool that determines if package module name shadows built-in module name
