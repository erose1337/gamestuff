to do:
----


refactor gui code into separate modules
name abilities/trees/effect in sequence so that there are no name collisions with set/get/del attr

theme designer applet


add energy source drop-down box for abilities?
remove homing option?
    - defining a fair cost seems difficult
    - completely negates ability to dodge, assuming target is within range
    - no reason not to take it if it's cheap
    - still worth taking if it's expensive?


determine how aoe works
    - aoe=0 means hits only target
    - aoe=1 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=2 hits all entities < 2 squares away

    or
    - aoe=target hits only target
    - aoe=0 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=1 hits all entities <= 1 square away
    - aoe=2 hits all entities <= 2 squares away

implement aoe for passives?
figure out movement effects
implement summon effects


fix format_attributes to display nicely spaced entries


break long text lines into multiple lines



Known Issues
------
Expressions such as 2 ^ (2 ^ 128) in the rules can cause the program to hang



Unrelated
----
write tool that determines if package module name shadows built-in module name


Roadmap
-----

finish implementing effects - done?!

test/balance default rules + test ai + how to write rules
multiple characters on a team (NvK e.g. monster warrior)
hero/villain status and persuading defeated enemies to join
origin story, quests, equipment
basic graphics (placeholders) and minimum viable product
world maps (graphics)
