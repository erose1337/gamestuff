to do:
----
enforce ability/effect limits based on current XP in character sheet

- add shooting stars to background
- make night-from-space background

re-do menus
    - create character
    - load character
        - select world
        - select place
        - select event
    - options
        - color options
        - exit from the options menu
            - save character when exiting

consider moving aoe to effects rather than abilities

make grid cell text toggle-able

add battles to gui
    - make a grid - done
    - place characters in a given region in the grid - done
    - collect input from players
        - select an ability
            - use the selection from the abilities viewer to select an ability
            - left click on grid to select target(s)
        - click accept button to submit action to queue

    - process
    - display effects in gui
    - outcome

put increment costs on tip bar text for -/+ buttons in attributes/affinities

rules editor
move save character from options to character screen

change menus to nested/recursive menus where appropriate

change back to grid

add energy source drop-down box for abilities?
remove homing option?
    - defining a fair cost seems difficult
    - completely negates ability to dodge, assuming target is within range
    - no reason not to take it if it's cheap
    - still worth taking if it's expensive?

determine how aoe works
    - aoe=0 means hits only target
    - aoe=1 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=2 hits all entities < 2 squares away

    or
    - aoe=target hits only target
    - aoe=0 hits all entities on targets position
    - aoe=1 hits all entities <= 1 square away
    - aoe=2 hits all entities <= 2 squares away

implement aoe for passives?
figure out movement effects
implement summon effects

fix format_attributes to display nicely spaced entries

Known Issues
------
Expressions such as 2 ^ (2 ^ 128) in the rules can cause the program to hang

text_background_color causes sdl2.ext.font to hiccup. The following change to sdl2.ext.font "fixes" it (but still doesn't display text background color)

    - had to install not yet accepted patch https://github.com/marcusva/py-sdl2/pull/134
