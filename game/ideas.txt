Stats
------------
    
- increased via points and assignment
- stat points gained from: combat experience
- combat experience factors:
    - min(1, (target_base + target_level - self_level)) * min(1.0, (damage_dealt_to_target / target_health))
    - difficulty * participation 
    - being at a much higher level against a low value target = less experience
    - dealing insignificant amounts of damage to a target = less experience
